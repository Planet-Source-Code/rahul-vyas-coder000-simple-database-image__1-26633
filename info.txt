This code demonstrates a simple way to save Images (or any binary 
data for that matter) into a database...
I would like to receive all kinds of comments and suggestions 
so, please give the same...

I assume that you have made an Access DataBase named: pic.mdb 
in the folder where you extract these files, This database must have 
a table named - Table1 and this table must have a field - img 
of datatype OLE Object
